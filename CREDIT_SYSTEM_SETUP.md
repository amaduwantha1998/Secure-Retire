## üîß Implementation Details

### Credit Guard Usage
```typescript

import { getCreditOperation } from '@/utils/creditOperations';

// Wrap any credit-consuming action
<CreditGuard
  operation={getCreditOperation('RETIREMENT_CALCULATION')}
  onProceed={async () => {
    // Your feature logic here
    await performCalculation();
  }}
>
  <Button>Calculate Retirement Plan</Button>
</CreditGuard>
```

### Route Protection
```typescript
import { CreditProtectedRoute } from '@/components/credits/CreditProtectedRoute';

// Protect entire pages/routes
<CreditProtectedRoute
  requiredCredits={5}
  featureName="Advanced Portfolio Analysis"
>
  <AdvancedAnalysisComponent />
</CreditProtectedRoute>
```

### Credit Deduction Flow
1. User clicks credit-protected action
2. `CreditGuard` checks if user has sufficient credits
3. Shows confirmation modal (for non-Pro users)
4. Calls `deduct-credits` edge function
5. Updates UI with new credit balance
6. Executes the actual feature

3. Deploy `deduct-credits` edge function
4. Test credit deduction flow
