## Next Steps Required üîß

### 1. Apply Database Schema

3. Click "Run" to execute the migration
4. Verify the tables were created: `subscriptions` and `credits`

### 2. Enable Supabase Integration in PricingStep
**Priority: HIGH**

After applying the schema, uncomment the database integration code in `src/components/register/PricingStep.tsx`:

- Lines 60-84: Uncomment the subscription saving logic
- Lines 139-148: Uncomment the transaction ID update logic

### 3. Set up Cron Job for Credit Reset
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Set up the monthly credit reset function:

1. Deploy the `reset-monthly-credits` edge function
2. Enable pg_cron extension in Supabase
3. Schedule the cron job as documented in the SQL file
